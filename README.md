# LLM-Red-Teaming-Prompt-Injection-Defender.
Overview:
The LLM Red-Teaming & Prompt-Injection Defender is an advanced cybersecurity framework designed to simulate, analyze, and defend against adversarial attacks targeting Large Language Models (LLMs). As AI systems become integral to modern applications, securing them from prompt injection, jailbreaks, and data exfiltration has become critical. This project provides a structured, research-backed platform for both offensive testing and defensive mitigation, bridging the gap between AI development and cybersecurity.

Purpose & Objectives:
The project’s goal is to empower developers, security researchers, and AI engineers to:

Understand the vulnerabilities unique to LLM-driven systems.

Simulate real-world adversarial attacks to test model robustness.

Implement defensive layers capable of detecting and neutralizing malicious prompts in real time.

Key Features:

 Attack Simulation Engine: Automates common AI exploitation vectors, including prompt injection, data leakage, model hijacking, and contextual override.

 Defense Module: Employs prompt sanitization, content filtering, and contextual validation to block or neutralize malicious inputs.

 Visualization Dashboard: Streamlit-based interface for monitoring attacks, tracking responses, and visualizing threat patterns.

 Modular Design: Built on LangChain, FastAPI, and Docker for flexibility, scalability, and secure isolation of red-team tests.

 OWASP Alignment: Implements test cases aligned with the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications.

Technologies Used:
Python, LangChain, FastAPI, Streamlit, OpenAI API, Ollama, Docker, and dotenv.

Why It Matters:
AI security is one of the most urgent frontiers in cybersecurity today. This project replicates how modern attackers manipulate LLMs while providing robust countermeasures, making it a valuable learning and portfolio asset for professionals aiming to specialize in AI Security, Red Teaming, or Defensive Automation.

Outcome:
A complete, demo-ready system showcasing expertise in AI threat modeling, prompt engineering defense, and LLM-based application security, built to set a new standard for proactive AI protection.

## What’s in this repo

* **Offensive**: attack corpus + attack generator (prompt injection, jailbreaks, chain attacks)
* **Defensive**: rule-based sanitizer, ML classifier hook, safety-check chain, policy enforcement (OPA-ready)
* **Observability**: structured logs + Streamlit dashboard for runs & explainability traces
* **Deploy**: FastAPI backend, Docker compose, CI tests, demo notebook

## Quickstart (5–10 mins)

**Prereqs**: Python 3.10+, Docker (optional), Git, OpenAI or Ollama API key.

1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-redteam.git
cd llm-redteam
```

2. Create virtual env & install

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create `.env` (DO NOT commit)

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
OLLAMA_API_URL="http://localhost:11434"   # optional
```

4. Run API (dev)

```bash
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload
```

5. Run dashboard

```bash
streamlit run src.dashboards/app.py
```

6. Run example attack (quick test)

```bash
python examples/run_attack.py --model openai --attack simple_injection
```

---

## Docker (optional)

```bash
docker build -t llm-redteam:local .
docker-compose up --build
# visits: http://localhost:8501 (Streamlit) and http://localhost:8000 (FastAPI)
